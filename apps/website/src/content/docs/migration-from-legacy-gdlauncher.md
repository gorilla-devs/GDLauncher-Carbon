# Migration from legacy GDLauncher

If you're still using the GDLauncher Legacy, the migration to GDLauncher Carbon is simple. Here's how you can do it.

## Download GDLauncher Carbon

You can download GDLauncher Carbon from the [official website](https://gdlauncher.com).

## Install / Replace GDLauncher Carbon

Once you've downloaded the new version, you can install it by following the installation instructions for your operating system [here](/docs/installation).
Installing GDLauncher Carbon will replace the old version as they share the same exact app id. By installing GDLauncher Carbon you will not lose any of your old instances.

## Auto Import your old instance

After running GDLauncher Carbon and logging in, you'll be welcomed with an onboarding modal that will ask you if you want to import your old instances. This will allow you to keep all your old instances.

## Manually Import your old instance

If for any reason the auto import doesn't work, you should first of all report the issue to us [here](https://discord.gdlauncher.com).
You can manually import your old instances by doing the following:
- Create a new instance in GDLauncher Carbon with the same configuration. If it's a modpack, install the same exact version of the modpack. If it's a vanilla instance, install the same version of minecraft and modloader.
- Open old GDLauncher data path.
- Copy the content of the instance folder from the old GDLauncher instance path to the new GDLauncher Carbon instance path. Refer to the [troobleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) page for details on the data path, or you can simply right click the instance tile and click "Open Instance Folder".
