title: Using MDX files
category: Integrations

## How to get started?

Once the integration is installed, it is as easy as adding `.mdx` files within your `src/pages/` directory to get started. Let's swap our project's `index.astro` for an `index.mdx` to test this out. Regardless if you're building with Astro or not, please note these two files are not one-to-one. A standalone `*.mdx` file does require an HTML boilerplate to give our browser the full information about our project. So let's see how Astro helps us with this.

We can interact with our `*.mdx` files from the perspective of two parts: (1) _Frontmatter_, a composable YAML-based section to declare your document's meta data and (2) the body composed of _MDX-syntax_ content.

```md
---
layout: ../layouts/Page.astro
title: Index
# <- These key-value pairs will be accessible via
# <- the `frontmatter` property from any `.astro` file
---

# Hello world

<!-- This content will be accessible via -->
<!-- the `<slot /> element -->
```

Anything written in inside the frontmatter fence (`---`) is accessible via the `frontmatter` property. So you can expect `title` in addition to the Astro provided key-value pairs to result in a payload like this (except for `layout`):

```js
{
  title: 'Index',
  file: '/../../../../../src/pages/index.mdx',
  url: '',
  astro: {}
}
```

## Where does TailwindCSS come in?

Let's get back to that `layout` property we declared in our frontmatter. Think of [Layouts](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/layouts/) as reusable page shells where you'd inject content using the `<slot /`> element. They are useful for all of your HTML boilerplate and common UI elements (such as headers, navbars, footers and more). Layout components are commonly placed in a `src/layouts` directory in your project. So let's add a `Page.astro` layout file to see how that looks:

```jsx
---
<!-- Server-side scripting can be done here -->
const { frontmatter: title } = Astro.props;
---
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <slot /> <!-- Your content is injected here -->
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here is where you have HTML markup available to style your Astro project using TailwindCSS. In Astro, you are able to use the standard `kebab-case` format for all HTML attributes instead of the `camelCase` used in JSX. It even works for `class`, which is not supported by React.
