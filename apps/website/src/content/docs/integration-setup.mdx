## What to know about integrations?

[Astro Integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) can change the function and look of your projects with a single line of code. Astro has several official integrations to choose from. Broadly speaking, integrations can help you:

- ...bring your UI framework of choice (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.),
- ...change Astro into SSR mode, fetching all data at request time,
- ...transform and model content easier (with MDX and TailwindCSS among others).

Getting started with integrations is incredibly easy. For official integrations, the `astro add` CLI automates installations for you. Installing with NPM you run `npx astro add mdx` and `npx astro add tailwind` to get your project bootstrapped with both. Detailed instructions on how to install and/or troubleshoot can be found in: [Using Integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/).

## What happens under the hood?

The `astro add` CLI, installs the NPM packages and applies the integrations into your `astro.config.*` file. Additionally, for TailwindCSS it creates its own `tailwind.config.cjs` file with the necessary file extensions for HTML, MD, MDX and all supported UI frameworks.

## Nice combo to have

When working with Markdown files (locally or remotely) and TailwindCSS, we'd also recommend installing the following dev dependencies:

- [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) official plugin gives you default styles for your HTML that work straight out of the box (see [installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin#installation)).
- [Automatic class sorting with Prettier](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier) with `prettier` and `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` just makes sense to keep your utility classes in order (see [installation](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss#installation)).
